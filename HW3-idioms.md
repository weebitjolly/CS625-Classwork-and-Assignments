# Data
The three dastasets I decided to use was the **norfolk water quality dataset**, **Gate Cuttoff Dataset**, and the **Amazon Stocks Dataset**

## Data Preprocessing
there wasn't much I had to do in terms of data pre-processing, the data is already pretty clean. The only changes I actually made was before creating the visual for the amazon highs and lows I created monthly average aggregations.

## Visualization Idioms & visual encoding choices

For this idiom I wanted to see what plants processed the different types of compounds. essentially the federal government classifies different compounds into different categories based on how important they are as contaminants in tap water (i.e. Primary, Secondary, Unregulated). The idiom itself was a good choice because we have two categorical variables that we want to plot along with their counts as a quantitative variable on the y-axis. we can see that across the board different compouns are processed at equal levels at each of the two locations

| Data: Attribute | Data: Attribute Type |  Encode: Channel |

|                 |                      |                  |
|                 |                      |                  |
|                 |                      |                  |
